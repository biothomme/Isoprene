# Emulating land surface models using neural operators
Tjena! This is the repository of a master project at the university of Uppsala supervised by David Dao, Lucas Czech and Björn Lütjens. The project bases on the idea to decrease computational load of global environmental models using bricks of neural networks. Indeed it sounds big but the humble collaboration tried its best to explore the possibilities of physics-informed land surface or terrestrial biosphere models. In the end the time was too narrow to gain further insights but it helped a lot in understanding the topic and applying code for some problems.

Ways around? The [index file](./docs/INDEX.yml) describes (or at least is intended to describe) the organization of this repository.
