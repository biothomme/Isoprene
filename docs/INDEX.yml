CORE:
  DATA:
    PATH:
      ../cache
    meta:
      All the data should be stored here. Best would be in subdirectories.
  
  CODE: 
    PATH:
      ../src
    meta:
      All code packages should be found here. Subdirectories for subsequent ideas.

  DOCUMENTATION:
    PATH:
      ../docs
    meta:
      Files that allow communication and presentation of the project are desired to be structured here.
    
    PRESENTATION:
      PATH:
        ../docs/presentations
      meta:
        For different types of slides for presentations. Large files should not be gitted here.
    
    REPORTING:
      PATH:
        ../docs/reporting
      meta:
        For reports, and work progress documentation files.
  
  NOTEBOOKS:
    PATH:
      ../notebooks
    meta:
      It makes sense to divide code and notebooks. Thus, they should be linked via import by __init__.py files (at least from src -> notebooks). Notebooks should be split into subdirectories as well as numbered.

  CATALOG:
    PATH:
      ../PATHS.yml
    meta:
      This is the most important file, keeping track of all important files that could be imported in any code. YAML-type allows simple importing.
