## Meeting 01 <a id="M01"></a>
#### *14th April 2022*
Brief intro to LSMs. There are too many submodels within large LSMs. So important to focus on a smaller bit; e.g. a submodel. Thus, we need to prioritize. First step would be ranking these submodels (e.g. the bits listed by CLM) by (1) importance for policy, (2) connectedness to forests, (3) computational bottleneck and (4) the ease of access of the submodel. Especially point 3 can be split into two different perspectives. (3a) is on the computational load, (3b) or the accuracy in parametrization. These two splits correspond to the 2 main usages of PINNs: (3a) Emulators, which are surrogates for parametric ODE systems and (3b) PINNs for subgrid parametrization that combine large grid models and PINNs for producing more fine scaled analyses.
